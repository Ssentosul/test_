'''Let's use data types to calculate the tax information for a product in the e-commerce store.

Assign the integer 10 to a variable named total.
Assign the float 0.3 to a variable named tax_rate.
Create a variable named tax by multiplying total and tax_rate.
Update total by adding the tax value to it. You can use the += operator.
Display total, tax_rate, and tax using print().'''

total=10
tax_rate=0.3

tax=total*tax_rate

total +=tax

print(total)
print(tax_rate)
print(tax)
